# Ceasing Data Sharing for Secondary Users

This allows an account holder to indicate that they no longer approve disclosure initiated by a secondary user to a particular accredited party. For more information, see [Ceasing Secondary User Sharing â€“ Consumer Data Standards Australia](https://cdr-support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5465006047375).

Enabling this feature stops data sharing for secondary accounts on all consents created with different Accredited Data Recipients (ADRs) maintained by the blocked legal entity. So that the relevant secondary accounts will be unavailable for the consents related to ADRs maintained by the blocked legal entities during the consent creation and consent amendment flows.

This feature allows an account holder to perform the following two activities.

1. The account holder can view and manage all accounts, secondary users, legal entities and their sharing status in the consent manager dashboard.

2. The account holder can block a legal entity to cease the disclosure initiated by a secondary user for a particular account to that legal entity so that during the consent creation and amendment flows, the relevant secondary account will be unavailable for consents arising through the aforementioned legal entity and all the ADRs under that legal entity.
